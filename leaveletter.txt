Dear Sir,

     With best regards and humble submission, My brother suffers typhoid and also he admitted at hospital in past one week. Doctors suggest to test again some test's are taken from outside of the hospial. So I went hospital . 
In this circumstances, I apologize you for one day leave (10-12-2021).
     Iâ€™ll be thankful for your kindness.
                                           Thanking you, 


                                                                                Yours faithfully,
